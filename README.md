# K.O.
A Smash Bros. style mod for Quake 1. Works with both traditional Quake maps where you will entitys will be knocked back more as their health decreases, and Smash style maps where your knockback rises with each hit and you have to blast your opponents into the boundaries of the map.

Compatible with most versions of Quake, though on older source ports transparency effects used might not work. Compatible with remastered, mapdb.json included so all you have to do is start a multiplayer game, bring down the console, type "game ko" and you should be good to go!

Be sure to bind impulse 100 for dash ability.

Notes for mappers
-
- Use "func_killsky" for the boundaries of the map. 
- Any map without a func_killsky will automatically be set to traditional damage mode rather than Smash style damage mode.
- Preferably use royalty-free textures.

Planned Features
-
- Projectiles can be parried with the axe.
- Spread shot alt firing mode for the nailgun.
- Items such as Quad, Lightning, and Railgun being timed powerups.
